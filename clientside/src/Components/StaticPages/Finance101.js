            <h3>Who can donate to federal political campaigns?</h3>
            <p>
              Anyone 18 over over and who is a U.S. Citizen or permanent
              resident may donate to the campaigns of federal candidates.
              Political action committees (PACs), often ran by organizations or
              companies, can also donate.
            </p>

            <h3>Are there limits?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, there are limits to how much an individual or political
              action committee may contribute to a candidate. For an individual
              the limit is $2,900 per election. That means that an individual
              could donate $2,900 to a candidate for a primary election, and if
              the candidate advances to the general election, an individual
              could donate another $2,900.
            </p>
            <p>
              Political action committees (PACs) can donate up to $2,900 or
              $5,000 directly to a candidate, depending on the type of PAC.
            </p>
            <p>
              Super PACs may accept unlimited contributions from individuals,
              corporations, labor organizations. However, Super PACs can only
              engage in independent expenditures (described below). Unlike
              regular PACs, Super PACs cannot donate directly to a candidate.

          <div className="mt-4 card info-card">
            <h3>Can anyone find out who donated and how much they donated?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, federal candidates must file campaign finance reports
              indicating the name, address, date, and amount of each
              contribution. For contributions by individuals, their occupation
              and employer name will also be included. That information is
              public record - anyone can look it up.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="mt-4 mb-4 card info-card">
            <h3>What about independent expenditures?</h3>
            <p>
              Committees, as well as Super PACs, may also publicly support or
              oppose a candidate and spend money towards those efforts. They
              can't coordinate or communicate privately in any way with the
              candidate's campaign nor donate directly to a candidate. Instead,
              they can spend unlimited money on expenses, like online or TV ads,
              phone calls, text messages, and postcards to voters.
